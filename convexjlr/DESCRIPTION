Description: convexr provides a simple high-level wrapper for Convex.jl,
    which makes it easy to describe and solve convex optimization problems in R.
    The problems can be dealt with include:
    linear programs,
    second-order cone programs (SOCP),
    semidefinite programs (SDP),
    exponential cone programs.
